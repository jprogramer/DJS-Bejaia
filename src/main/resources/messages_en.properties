geography=Geography
geology=Geology
geologyInfo1=The topography of the Algerian coast is characterized by the succession from the current shore and up to an altitude of more than 300 meters, a series of steps arranged one above the other like the steps of a staircase. These steps abruptly interrupt the continuity of the slopes, generally very fast, which border the Algerian coast.
geologyInfo2=This finding of this provision appears by exploring the Algerian coast from west to east from the vicinity of Andalusia and from Arzew to Oran to the west, to T\u00E9n\u00E8s, to Cherchell, to Bou Isma\u00EFl, to Bouzar\u00E9ah. Algiers, Th\u00E9nia in the center of the Algerian coast, Jijel, Skikda and Annaba to the east. As a result, the geological study of the Algiers region, which is not very extensive at the surface and forms a rock that juts out into the sea, reveals that behind it is covered by a string of dunes, beyond which we find the lands sediments of the tertiary series. In a geological and topographic sketch of the coastline of Algiers dating from 1911, it appears that this coast includes essentially the entire lower region which borders on more than 100 kilometers the foot of the Atlas, from the Sidi F\u00E9redj massif to the north of Th\u00E9nia from B\u00E9ni A\u00EFcha to Mount Ch\u00E9noua west of Tipaza Latin Europe, Germanic Europe, and the Slavic countries.
weather=Weather
weatherInfo=Located in the Tel, in northern Algeria, this wilaya has a Mediterranean climate where summers are hot and dry and winters are mild and rainy and sometimes snowy.
geographyInfo=The wilaya of Algiers represents by its strategic position, as capital of, an essential crossroads between Eurasia and Western Europe via North Africa. Thus, the commercial, cultural and political exchanges are intense between the wilaya of Algiers and the countries of the Arab world.
history=History
historyInfo1=In June 1974, during the creation of the wilayas of Blida and Bouira, the wilaya of Algiers counts only thirty-three communes.
historyInfo2=On December 15, 1983, the creation of the wilayas of Boumerd\u00E8s and Tipaza reduced its territory again.
historyInfo3=In 1994, the wilaya passed from thirty-three to thirty-eight communes by recovering the communes of Rouiba, Regha\u00EFa, H'raoua, A\u00EFn Taya and El Marsa which were detached from the wilaya of Boumerd\u00E8s created ten years rather.
historyInfo4=In August 1997, the creation of the governorate replaces the wilaya of Algiers with a minister-governor who will be Cherif Rahmani. While the wilaya had thirty-eight communes, the governorate passes to fifty-seven communes by integrating nineteen communes which depended on wilayas of Tipaza and Blida. The municipalities absorbed are: A\u00EFn Benian, Cheraga, Ouled Fayet, Hammamet, Saoula, Mahelma, Rahmania, Souidania, Staoueli, Zeralda, Baba Hassen, Douera, El Achour, Draria, Khra\u00EFssia, Birtouta, Ouled Chebel, Tessala El Merdja, Sidi Moussa .
historyInfo5=In 2000, the governorate of the Grand of Algiers was dissolved because of the unconstitutionality of the new structure. Algiers becomes a wilaya while keeping its new territory of fifty-seven communes.
